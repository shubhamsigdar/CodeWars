# Coding-Challenges

I've made it a habit to complete at least one Javascript coding challenge a day. These challenges are a great way to practice spaced repition and active recall of Javascript fundamentals.




# How It's Made:

Tech used: JavaScript



# Lessons Learned:

Each challenge forces me to be patient and recall the patterns used to solved a problem. I've learned to think better and to find more creative ways to become unstuck.
